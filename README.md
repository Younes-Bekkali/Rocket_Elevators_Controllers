WEEK#3: The commercial controller codes using C sharp and GoLang codes

The test is four different scenarios for different columns, directions, and floors.

To test the C# using the VS code terminal, after launching the code using "dotnet run", you'll be asked to answer the number of a scenario from 1 to 4 for the four different scenarios 1 to 4. after each scenario you'll be asked  if you want to proceed to another scenario or not (y/n).

To test the Golang code using the VS code: " go run Commercial_Controller_GoLang.go" on the terminal. Nothing to simulate yet, almost done but still needs a final touch. 

For Java I used Eclipse, I took advantage of its similiraties with C# , the code almost done , but also not tried yet.


WEEK#2: The residential controller codes using Javascript and Python codes

Open the "Residential_Controller.html" and press on the button to test the javascript code. You can also use Node.js and the deboger to access to the consol. For the Python code you can just ran the code.

The test is 3 scenarios where two elevators are simulated in diffent levels, directions and states. For the javascript code you can run one scenario at the time and comment out the others. In the case of the the Python you can run the three at the same time. the results for the different scenarios are shown on the consol.
